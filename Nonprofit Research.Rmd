## Research on Nonprofits serving specific communities as outlined in the Kennecott Foundation Report.

### Data source and methods

Data was collected from GuideStar.org, which claims to be the worldâ€™s largest source of information on nonprofit organizations. Filters were applied to narrow down nonprofits by their location and National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE) codes for efficacy. The National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities codes are a system used by the Internal Revenue Service to classify nonprofit organizations. The locations of the nonprofits were limited to Salt Lake County and Toole County.

The biggest nonprofits were identified by examining their total assets. For each cause area, the top 50 nonprofits were determined and their data was collected and analyzed. 


### Results

Figure 1. depicts the top 10 nonprofits that are operational in Utah. 
These nonprofits have been categorized into the various color codes  according to their NTEE codes, 
IHC Health Services Inc. (classified as E21: Community Health System as per the NTEE system), topped the list with assets close to $10 billion but was removed from the list since its magnitude overwhelmed the display of the other nonprofits. 
The other prominent NTEE categories that operate in Utah include E31: Group Health Practice, T22: private independent foundations, E12: fund raising and/or fund distribution, B11: single organization support, B43: University or technological , T30: public foundations, T21: Corporate foundations.

Figure 2 depicts the top 5 nonprofits that operate in Salt Lake County and Tooele County.
IHC Health Services Inc., which operates out of Salt Lake County, was removed from Figure 2 to improve the visibility of the other nonprofits in the figure.

The nonprofits were further narrowed down by their specific cause areas and NTEE codes. These are described in the following sections. 



#### Mental Health, Crisis Intervention

As outlined in the Kennecott Foundation Community Needs report, mental health aspects (including opioid/addictive behaviors and depression) has been identified as one of the key areas the Foundation might consider addressing.

The specific NTEE code break down of nonprofits that focus on mental health is shown in Figure 4.

Figure 5 highlights the main nonprofits in this field, with Valley Mental Health Inc. being the top player. The smaller nonprofits such as First Step House and Odyssey House Inc.- Utah emerge as bigger players when addiction is made the sole focus of program as shown in Figure 6.

#### Employment, Job Related

The NTEE code breakdown for employment showed that Labor Unions dominated this field. Once these were filtered out, a meaningful breakdown of the various classifications could be visualized as shown in Figure 9.

Figure 10 shows the top nonprofits that focus on employment. Most of these foundations focus on various kinds of employment training, employment procurement assistance and vocational rehabilitation with the exception of Utah Mining Association, whose primary focus is Fund Raising and/or Fund Distribution benefiting the mining industry.

### Limitations: 
1. Nonprofits which did not supply their cause area data to GuideStar was not included in this study.
2. Nonprofits which did not supply information regarding their NTEE codes could be segmented and analyzed. 
3. Nonprofits located elsewhere but with operation in Salt Lake County of Tooele County could not be identified.
4. There was insufficient data on nonprofits in Tooele county and therefore further segmentation was not possible.
